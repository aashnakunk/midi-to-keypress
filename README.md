python midi_controller.py


Edit note_to_key and jump_chord in the script to customize mappings:

Edit `note_to_key` and `jump_chord` in the script to customize mappings.

For example:


note_to_key = {
    60: Key.up,       # C note â†’ Up arrow
    62: Key.down,     # D note â†’ Down arrow
    64: Key.left,     # E note â†’ Left arrow
    65: Key.right     # F note â†’ Right arrow
}

jump_chord = frozenset([60, 64, 67])  # C major chord â†’ Spacebar (jump)
jump_key = Key.space
You can map any MIDI note number (0â€“127) to any key from pynput.keyboard.Key or even characters like 'a', 'z', etc.
